# Using Laravel with GoDaddy

## Notes
While creating this walk-through, I was currently building the <a href="https://www.efinancetracker.com">eFinanceTracker</a> website.  You will see efinancetracker.com mentioned in some of the screenshots.  If you see information redacted (blacked-out) in a screenshot, it is because this may be sensitive data for the eFinanceTracker website and does not apply to you.

Also, the screenshots were taken in September 2022, so they may need to be updated.
