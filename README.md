## Introduction to GoDaddy

<a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> is my personal preference for web site hosting.  Not only is GoDaddy affordable, but they have amazing tech support and they have a 99.99% uptime.  With powerful tools built in, such as phpMyAdmin and cPanel, GoDaddy makes it easy to build and host your website from day one, regardless of your web design experience.  Plus, it is nice that I can find and purchase a domain name, purchase hosting, and install a SSL Certificate all in one place!
