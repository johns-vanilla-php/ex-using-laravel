## Introduction to GoDaddy

<a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> is my personal preference for web site hosting.  Not only is GoDaddy affordable, but they have amazing tech support and they have a 99.99% uptime.  With powerful tools built in, such as phpMyAdmin and cPanel, GoDaddy makes it easy to build and host your website from day one, regardless of your web design experience.  Plus, it is nice that I can find and purchase a domain name, purchase hosting, and install a SSL Certificate all in one place!

## Setup your first web page
Once you have purchased a domain name and hosting, you will need to create a basic web page that will show visitors that your new website is being built.  GoDaddy already creates this file for you, but you should edit it and make it more personal to your new site.  The default page that GoDaddy creates will be located in your public_html folder and is named home.html.  You can  in <a href="https://github.com/johns-vanilla-php/ex-using-laravel/tree/main/resources/html">find an example of this file</a> in this repository.
