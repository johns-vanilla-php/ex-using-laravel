# Software Requirements

For this tutorial, I am using Windows 10 with 4GB of RAM, so things might be a bit different if you are using Linux or iOS.

## <span id="vs_code">Visual Studio Code</span>

I began learning how to write HTML code using a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG or "Wizzy-Wig" editor) when GeoCities was still a thing.  After designing web pages visually, I would click on the source code and try to understand how the code was being rendered.  After a while, I started to use Microsoft FrontPage in an attempt to do even more.  I noticed that FrontPage was adding a lot of unnecessary things to my code, but it still helped me to understand what the code did.  Eventually, I started to use Notepad exclusively to design sites.  I had 100% control of what was being placed into my code, but it was difficult to keep things well organized.  A friend of mine introduced my to Visual Studio Code a few years ago and I have been using it since.  You can use any editor that you want.

You can download Visual Studio Code at <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a>

Once VS Code is installed, you should open it and install a few extensions.  The screenshots below will probably be different than what you are seeing, as you can customize the look of VS Code to fit your needs.

## <span id="xampp">XAMPP</span>

If you are using a Windows machine and Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code), then you will need to install PHP on your system as well.  The easiest way that I have done this is by downloading XAMPP.  You can install XAMPP onto your local hard drive OR you can also install it on a portable drive, such as a thumb drive.  For the purposes of this tutorial, I am going to install it on my local C drive.

Visual Studio Code works much better with a version of PHP installed.

## <span id="bash">Git Bash</span>

## <span id="filezilla">FileZilla</span>
